A sign language detection model
Welcome to the Sign Language to Words Converter repository! This project aims to provide a solution for converting sign language videos into written words using machine learning techniques.

## Overview
Sign language is a crucial means of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. However, it can pose challenges when it comes to understanding and translating the signs into spoken or written language. This repository offers a solution by utilizing machine learning algorithms to convert sign language videos into words, enabling better communication and accessibility for everyone.

## Features
Video Processing: The project utilizes computer vision techniques to extract relevant features from sign language videos.
Machine Learning Models: Trained models are implemented to classify the extracted features and recognize the corresponding sign gestures.
Word Generation: The recognized sign gestures are mapped to a dictionary to generate written words and provide accurate translations.
